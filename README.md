# extreme-feedback-device-driver

This is an example driver for the extreme feedback device "Thunder Missile Launcher".
The project also includes a build notification listener, listening for failed Jenkins builds and "retaliating" against developers that caused build failures.

The idea and USB protocol details were heavily based on https://github.com/codedance/Retaliation.
The project served as a demo for the talk [Build gecrasht? Feuer frei! - USB-Raketenwerfer und andere Feedback Devices](https://entwicklertag.de/karlsruhe/2016/build-gecrasht-feuer-frei) (in german) at EntwicklerTag Karlsruhe 2016.
